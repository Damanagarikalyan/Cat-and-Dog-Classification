cat and dog image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project involves building a model that can accurately distinguish between images of cats and dogs.

Objective:
Develop an accurate cat vs. dog image classification system using CNNs.
Collect a large dataset of labeled images containing cats and dogs.
Preprocess the data, design and train a CNN model, evaluate its performance, and deploy it for real-world use.
Steps Involved:
Data Collection: Gather a substantial dataset of labeled cat and dog images.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for training.
Model Design: Create a CNN architecture suitable for image classification.
Model Training: Train the model using the prepared dataset.
Model Evaluation: Assess the modelâ€™s performance using validation data.
Deployment: Deploy the trained model for practical use, such as identifying cats and dogs in new images.
